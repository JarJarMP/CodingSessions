## Today's goal
Create other Docker image based on Ubuntu and install Yeoman in it.

## Results
Yepp, this will be short entry, since we are simply unable to get yeoman in any kind of docker.. :(
We don't know the exact reason why and keep trying and searching for answers but it doesn't work neither on Linux host neither on Mac host. Also tried to go around the nodejs install and find a way to install it from package. That wasn't enough too.. We used [Kevin's](https://github.com/silarsis/yeoman/blob/master/Dockerfile) solution, but we got the same error messages as during our previous session.
