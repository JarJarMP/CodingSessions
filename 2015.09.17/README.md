## The idea
One of my latest idea is a bookmark manager app, which runs in the a browser and communicates with it via a Chrome extension. Today we've started with an empty angular app generated by Yeoman. Feature list, the app and the extension will be available on GitHub too.. with time :)

## Session without code is not a session...
```bash
$ npm install -g generator-angular-fullstack
$ yo angular-fullstack cs-bookmark-manager
